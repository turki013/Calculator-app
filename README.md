## Account-Based Calculator Application

This project is a **Java-based application** that combines basic account management features with a calculator tool. The program allows users to create and manage accounts while offering security and accessibility. After signing up and logging in, users gain access to a calculator within the application.

### Features:
1. **Sign Up**: Users can create a new account by providing their credentials.
2. **Login**: Existing users can log in to access the calculator functionality.
3. **Forgot Password**: Allows users to reset their password if they forget it.
4. **Reset Password**: Users can manually reset their account password.
5. **Delete Account**: Option to permanently delete an account from the system.
6. **Exit**: Safely exit the application.

### Workflow:
- On launching the application, the user is greeted with a menu offering account management options.
- After successful account creation and login, the user can access a basic calculator.
- User-friendly prompts and clear navigation make the application intuitive to use.

### Technical Details:
- **Language**: Java
- **Concepts Used**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), `do-while` loops, and `switch` statements.
- **Dependencies**: Utilizes the `Scanner` class for user input.

This project showcases foundational programming skills, emphasizing **user interaction**, **input validation**, and **menu-driven application development**.

### Purpose:
The project serves as an educational exercise in Java programming, focusing on integrating account management with a practical tool like a calculator. It demonstrates proficiency in **OOP principles**, logical control structures, and modular coding practices.
